# Word-Count-Programs-using-Hadoop-and-Spark

## Aim
The purpose of this project is to utilize Hadoop and Spark for efficient processing and improved fault tolerance in order to determine word counts from multiple large-sized text files.<br>
The word count algorithm implemented in this project disregards case sensitivity, eliminates unwanted punctuation, and excludes stop words during the counting process. This approach ensures high-speed processing while maintaining accuracy and relevance in the word count results.<br>
